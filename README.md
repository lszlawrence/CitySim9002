#IS2545 - DELIVERABLE 2: Unit Testing

I used IntelliJ to finish this deliverable.

The first issue i encountered is the object-oriented program. In the beginning i simply put all the public method in one
class. After that i think about write some object and put the appropriate method in corresponded class, so that i write
a visitor class, a location class and a preference class. Since i just simply put the visitor type and location in an 
array, i believe that's not a brilliant way, especially when i want to do some double test. 

The second issue is about git, some conflicts happen when i push my code second time, it cost me a lot of time to figure
out what's going on with git, finally i just simply force push it - - . 
 
Last issue is about test code, since the poor object-oriented design, i just have three return method which makes 
difficult to conduct more double and stub test. Some failures happen because of the incorrect usage of Junit and Mockito,
such as put anyInt() in a wrong place and try to mock an Integer.....

Finally, this is a quite interesting deliverable which helps me a lot in object-oriented design and quality assurance.
